# GEOCACHING PROJECT

**Personal Note**: This has to be an improved version of AmritaTrees. We've learnt alot, time to put it to use! Only use best practices and tools:

- Fastify
- MVC Pattern
- SQL db
- Sequelize ORM
- Cookie Session authentication
- Tailwind
- Handlebars

## Project Requirements

It's a Geocaching framework project, which means, I should be able to change the whole purpose of the project very elegantly.

1. Able to view map and user as they move along IRL
2. Geocaches should pop up in the map interface as the user gets closer to them
3. User should be able to interact with the geocache
4. User can add their own geocache at their current location
5. Inventory-like collection system
